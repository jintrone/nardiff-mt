    "story": "When Jason became a new parent, he and his partner felt very stressed and tired. They started eating badly and experienced chronic fatigue. Their poor eating habits contributed to their tiredness, as well as other health problems. Diets that are low in vitamins and minerals and high in calories and are also high in saturated fat, which is common in fast foods like pizza and burgers can cause people to feel sluggish and tired. To deal with their tiredness, Jason and his partner strived to develop easy to use strategies for eating 2-3 servings of  lean meats or beans and 5 servings fruits and vegetables daily. They learned that planning their meals ahead of time can help, and that others who have children may also be able to provide helpful advice. Oftentimes, family and friends will be happy to pitch in and help out if parents ask. Equipped with such knowledge and support, Jason and his partner developed good eating habits, which not only helped them maintain good energy levels, but also set a good example for their children.",

    "story": "When Judy went to college last year, she did not have enough time to prepare food by herself. She skipped breakfast often and consumed large amounts of unhealthy snack food from convenience stores. Her eating habits made her feel depressed. Skipping breakfast can make people crave high-calorie food (like chips and candy) later in the day. Moreover, junk food often contains many more calories than people need in a day. These extra calories are saved in the body as body fat. Jason, a friend of Judy's, has healthy eating habits. Judy decided to ask for advice from Jason. Jason had developed easy-to-follow strategies for eating well. He suggested eating a healthy breakfast to Judy that includes a lean protein and fruits or vegetables. Judy began eating breakfast and replaced high calorie snack-foods with regular, healthy meals including 5 servings of fruits or vegetables in a day. Her mood improved overall and she did better in school.",

The station building, near the junction of Strand and Surrey Street, opened in 1907 as the only other station on the Piccadilly line's short branch from Holborn. Suffering from low passenger numbers, the station and branch were considered for closure several times. Service was offered only during weekday peak hours from 1962 and finally discontinued altogether in 1994, when the cost of replacing the lifts was considered too high compared to the income generated. Disused parts of the station and the running tunnels were used to shelter artworks from the National Gallery during the First World War, and from the British Museum during the Second World War.",

    "story": "Ruth, a 50-year-old woman, living in the United States has a sedentary lifestyle. Ruth has healthy eating habits but her sedentary lifestyle puts her at risk for osteoporosis. Light stresses on the skeleton are necessary  for a body to maintain bone mass using Calcium and Vitamin D. This is especially important for middle-aged women. Too much bone loss can result in a condition known as osteoporosis. Ruth had a bone fracture from a fall on a floor one day. So, she visited a doctor to check her injury. The doctor asked about her daily routines as a usual procedure, and also suggested taking an X-ray. Then the doctor diagnosed Ruth with osteoporosis. Such a diagnosis led Ruth to realize that healthy eating habits that include dairy or other food that contains calcium and vitamin D are not enough to maintain healthy bones, and that she also needed to change her lifestyle. She followed suggestions from the doctor such as increasing walking or weight-bearing exercise, and tried to strengthen her bones.",

      "probe": "The American paddlefish is one of the largest freshwater fish in North America. Closely related to the sturgeon, it is one of only two extant taxa in the paddlefish family (the other being the Chinese paddlefish). The rostrum and cranium of American paddlefish are covered with tens of thousands of sensory receptors for locating swarms of zooplankton, their primary food source. American paddlefish are native to the Mississippi River Basin and once moved freely under the relatively natural, unaltered conditions that existed prior to the early 1900s. Their numbers have declined dramatically primarily because of overfishing, habitat destruction, and pollution. They are currently found in only twenty-two U.S. states, and their range has been reduced to the Mississippi and Missouri river tributaries and Mobile Bay drainage basin.",
