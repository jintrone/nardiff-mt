    "story": "There was a fox and a bear who were friends.  One day they decided to catch a chicken for supper.  They decided to go together, because neither one wanted to be left alone and they both liked fried chicken.\nThey waited until night time.

      "probe": "Aldwych tube station is a closed station on the London Underground, in the City of Westminster in central London. The station building, near the junction of Strand and Surrey Street, opened in 1907 as the only other station on the Piccadilly line's short branch from Holborn. Suffering from low passenger numbers, the station and branch were considered for closure several times. Service was offered only during weekday peak hours from 1962 and finally discontinued altogether in 1994, when the cost of replacing the lifts was considered too high compared to the income generated. Disused parts of the station and the running tunnels were used to shelter artworks from the National Gallery during the First World War, and from the British Museum during the Second World War.",

      "probe": "The American paddlefish is one of the largest freshwater fish in North America. Closely related to the sturgeon, it is one of only two extant taxa in the paddlefish family (the other being the Chinese paddlefish). The rostrum and cranium of American paddlefish are covered with tens of thousands of sensory receptors for locating swarms of zooplankton, their primary food source. American paddlefish are native to the Mississippi River Basin and once moved freely under the relatively natural, unaltered conditions that existed prior to the early 1900s. Their numbers have declined dramatically primarily because of overfishing, habitat destruction, and pollution. They are currently found in only twenty-two U.S. states, and their range has been reduced to the Mississippi and Missouri river tributaries and Mobile Bay drainage basin.",

    "story": "A few weeks ago, health care professionals saw an alarming spike in the number of people seeking medical care after being infected with measles.  Measles is a highly contagious disease that the World Health Organization estimates used to cause ~2.6 million deaths per year globally.\nIn the United States, the development and widespread use of vaccines has virtually eradicated the disease, but measles is periodically re-introduced when people travel to parts of the world where it is still prevalent.\nWidespread vaccination protects even those who have not been vaccinated themselves, because people who have been vaccinated cannot infect others.  This 'herd immunity' reduces the risk that unvaccinated people will be exposed to the measles virus in the first place.\nHerd immunity is useful, because some people (e.g., very young children) cannot be vaccinated.  Unfortunately, vaccination rates have dropped in some parts of the U.S., allowing the disease to spread there and increasing the risk of a more widespread outbreak.",

      "probe": "The Colorado River is the principal river of the Southwestern United States and northwest Mexico.  Known for its dramatic scenery and its whitewater, the Colorado carves numerous gorges, including the Grand Canyon in northern Arizona. For 8,000 years, the Colorado Basin was only sparsely populated by Native Americans, though some of their ancient civilizations employed advanced irrigation techniques. Even after becoming part of theU.S. in the 1800s, the Colorado River country remained extremely remote until John Wesley Powell's 1869 river-running expedition, which began to open up the river for future development. Since the completion of Hoover Dam in 1935, the Colorado has been tamed by an extensive system of dams and canals, providing for irrigation, cities, and hydropower. Today the Colorado supports 40 million people in seven U.S. and two Mexican states; with every drop of its water allocated, it no longer reaches the sea except in years of heavy runoff.",
