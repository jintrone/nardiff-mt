    "title": "Two frogs",
    "story": "One night two frogs found themselves in a dairy. Hopping and jumping around as frogs do  they both jumped into a milk pail half full of milk. After swimming around for some time they tried to get out. But the inside of the pail was too slippery and there was nothing on which they could rest so that they could jump out. One frog thought it was useless trying to swim on and just gave up hope and sunk and was drowned. The other carried on swimming hoping against hope that something would turn up. He swam and he swam until he began to feel tired. But by this time the milk which was full of cream had become thick. When the frog had swum some more the cream had been stirred so much that it became a solid lump of butter. On this the frog could scramble and rest. And from it he could easily jump out of the pail into safety.",

      "probe": "Tardigrades can survive in extreme environments. For example, they can withstand temperatures from just above absolute zero to well above the boiling point of water (100 Â°C), pressures about six times greater than those found in the deepest ocean trenches, ionizing radiation at doses hundreds of times higher than the lethal dose for a human, and the vacuum of outer space. They can go without food or water for more than 10 years, drying out to the point where they are 3% or less water, only to rehydrate, forage, and reproduce. They are not considered extremophilic because they are not adapted to exploit these conditions. This means that their chances of dying increase the longer they are exposed to the extreme environments, whereas true extremophiles thrive in a physically or geochemically extreme condition that would harm most other organisms.",

    "title": "Farmer's daughter",
    "story": "A farmer's daughter had been out to milk the cows, and was returning to the dairy carrying her pail of milk upon her head. As she walked along, she fell a-musing after this fashion: The milk in this pail will provide me with cream, which I will make into butter and take to market to sell. With the money I will buy a number of eggs, and these, when hatched, will produce chickens, and by and by I shall have quite a large poultry yard. Then I shall sell some of my fowls, and with the money which they will bring in I will buy myself a new gown, which I shall wear when I go to the fair; and all the young fellows will admire it, and come and make love to me, but I shall toss my head and have nothing to say to them. Forgetting all about the pail, and suiting the action to the word, she tossed her head. Down went the pail, all the milk was spilled, and all her fine castles in the air vanished in a moment!",

      "probe": "The Zhuangzi is an ancient Chinese work from the late Warring States period (3rd century BC) which contains stories and anecdotes that exemplify the carefree nature of the ideal Daoist sage. Named for its traditional author, 'Master Zhuang', the Zhuangzi is one of the two foundational texts of Daoism, along with the Laozi (Dao De Jing). It is composed of a large collection of anecdotes, allegories, parables, and fables, which are often humorous or irreverent in nature. Its main themes are of spontaneity in action and of freedom from the human world and its conventions. The fables and anecdotes in the text attempt to illustrate the falseness of human distinctions between good and bad, large and small, life and death, and human and nature. While other philosophers wrote of moral and personal duty, Zhuangzi promoted carefree wandering and becoming one with 'the Way' by following nature.",
      "question": "Based on the passage above, which of the following is false about the Zuangzi?",
      "answers": [
        "One of its main themes is freedom from the human world and its conventions",
        "It is an ancient Chinese literary work",
        "It is one of the foundational texts of Daoism",
