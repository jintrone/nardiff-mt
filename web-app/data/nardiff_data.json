When Ruth visited a doctor to check her injury, the doctor asked about her daily routines. The doctor ordered an X-ray. and found a fracture. The doctor diagnosed Ruth with osteoporosis, which is a loss of bone density, and explained the diagnosis. The doctor told Ruth that a healthy diet and physical activity are both needed to maintain healthy bones. The doctor suggested walking more and doing weight-bearing exercises. Ruth began walking each day to and from the store, and began exercising regularly with light weights. This reduced the rate at which her bones were losing mass, helping her to avoid more serious fractures in the future. Older women lose bone mass more quickly than younger women, making it easier to break bones, and without physical activity, a person's body doesn't use calcium and vitamin D to replenish bone mass as effectively.

This might lead a young man to notice that his skin starts to look unhealthy. A young man might visit a dermatologist, who might ask about his stress levels and water consumption. The dermatologist might suggest that he practice meditation, and drink more water throughout the day. The person might learn from the dermatologist that stress can have detrimental effects on skin, like acne or worsening eczema, and being dehydrated also has negative consequences for skin tone. Knowing this might help him to follow the dermatologist's advice, taking an online meditation course and drinking more water throughout the day. This can reduce his stress levels, and he might begin sleeping better. Along with increased hydration, this can make his skin healthier. "
